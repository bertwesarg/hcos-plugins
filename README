HCOS GCC Plug-ins

The plug-ins in this package were produced as part of research done by
the HCOS group.  Some of them are directly useful, while some serve as
useful examples for plug-in development.

These plug-ins are distributed under the terms of the GPL version 3,
which is included in the file COPYING.

What is HCOS?

The High-Confidence Operating Systems project is a research group at
Stony Brook University's computer science deparment.  Our research
focuses on self-monitoring software, so we are especially interested
in compiler-assisted instrumentation.

The HCOS web site is at:

What does this package include?

--- INSTALL ---

The INSTALL file explains how to build and use these plug-ins.

--- Verbose Dump ---

The verbose dumper is a diagnostic tool for GCC and GCC plug-in
developers.  Verbose Dump does not transform any code; it outputs
internal compiler information during compilation, including:

For each file:
1. Call graph: The graph of calls between functions within the file.

For each function:
2. c-trees: GCC's internal abstract syntax tree (AST).

3. CFG: The control-flow graph for basic blocks in the function.

For each basic block:
4. GIMPLE: GCC's internal programming langauge- and
architecture-independent intermediate representation.  GIMPLE is a
three-address code.
